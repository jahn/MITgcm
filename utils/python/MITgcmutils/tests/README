To test any changes to MITgcmutils, do the following in the "tests" directory:
1. Download reference data and baseline_images:
    wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=2 -R 'index.html*' 'https://engaging-web.mit.edu/~jahn/MITgcmutils/'
   This will add to the "data" subdirectory and create a "baseline_images" directory.
2. Install needed python versions (python3.8, ..., python3.12).
3. Install tox.
4. Run "tox" in ".." (or "tox -e py38" or similar to test a single python version)
5. Run "tests/run-scripts py38" (or other python version) in ".." to test gluemncbig.
   It will generatae some .cdl, .md5 and .nc files.
